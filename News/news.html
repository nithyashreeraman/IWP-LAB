 <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (2.2–3.3 lb), 
      while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15–24 lb). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.
      As English has become the international language of business and technology, newspapers formerly in
       non-English (only) languages have been publishing an English-language edition. In places as varied as
        Jerusalem and Bombay (Mumbai), newspapers are printed to a local and international English-speaking public.
         The advent of the Internet has also allowed the non-English
       newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.
</p>
<p>A puppy's coat color may change as 
      the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
      Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location
       to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect
        changes in advertising — the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for 
        editorial — or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change
         from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. 
         As the content can vary widely,
       zoned editions are often produced in parallel.

        Born after an average of 63 days of gestation, puppies emerge in an amnion that is bitten off
         and eaten by the mother dog.Puppies begin to nurse almost immediately. If the litter exceeds
          six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding the 
          stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother.
           As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food. The mother may 
           regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid food.
            The mother usually
         refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.
         They love to be active. They like the water no matter what temperature outside as their coat protects them.

                The practice of docking began primarily as a preventive measure for injury among working dogs. 
                Docking is now primarily performed for purely cosmetic reasons, and some breeds traditionally 
                have their tails cropped anywhere from slightly to almost entirely.[8] Many countries now ban
                 cropping and docking for cosmetic purposes, including Australia, parts of Canada, the majority
                  of the European countries (Austria, Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, the Czech Republic, 
                  Turkey, Poland, Slovakia, England, Scotland, Slovenia, Ireland, Norway and Sweden), while others, 
                such as the United States, permit it.
                Labrador retrievers are gentle and loving. They make great family dogs. They are intelligent, agile,
                 and kind dogs. They also are very energetic, and need exercise every day.
                 As a pet,
          they can be demanding of attention and are best suited in a home where they can have a daily workout.
          This tough, hardy breed of retriever is a great choice as a family pet.They are playful, 
          easy to train, and naturally obedient.

                     Puppies are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with 
                     either their mother or littermates. When puppies are socialized with humans, particularly 
                     between the ages of eight and twelve weeks, they develop social skills around people.
                      Those that do not receive adequate socialization
                      during this period may display fearful behavior around humans or other dogs as adults. 
                      Labradors are descended from dogs bred on the island of Newfoundland, in Canada. Its ancestor is 
                      the St. John's water dog, a breed that developed through breedings by early settlers of the island in 
                      the 16th century.
These dogs were trained to bring in the fishing nets from the icy waters for the fishermen. 
They are strong swimmers as they have webbing between the toes on their paws.
