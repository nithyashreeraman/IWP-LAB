        <h2>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="dept-info">
            The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 2017. It has become the
             School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCOPE) in January 2019. At present, the School 
             is headed by Dr. Babu with 3565 students, 79 faculty and 94 research scholars. 
             The School has qualified and committed faculty members who offer impressive instruction in a
              variety of modes, exploring experiential learning approaches and new pedagogical methods in
               order to provide proper learning to students. The school provides the necessary 
            infrastructure, hardware, and software to support the faculty for their continuous learning and research.
            The curricula of programmes have been designed to cater to the ever
             changing needs and demands of IT industry. The focus is on holistic learning and
              empowering students to make significant contributions at all levels. The cafeteria system of
             electives gives a handful of choices for the students to develop expertise in their area of interest.
        <br>
        <br>
        The school has 15 computer labs and two specialization labs. These labs are equipped with the latest
         desktops, networking devices, and advanced computers for students to learn, experience, and create their
          codes and project works. Various softwares such as Dev C++, Python, Matlab, 
        R, OpenGL, Processing, Blender, Eclipse, Ubuntu, Rational Rose, Oracle etc are made available to students.
        Computer Science is an ever-evolving discipline that studies the theory, design and implementation 
        of computer applications and systems. Computers and computer systems play a central role in business,
         communication, science, entertainment and medicine. As the range of computer applications continues to
          expand, so does the demand for computer scientists. With a focus on nurturing bright minds and
           developing real-world problem solving skills in them, 
        the department of Computer Science and Engineering at VIT-AP offers the following programmes.
        Technical Events such as Hack-a-thon, Code-a-thon are conducted to hone the programming skills of 
        the students and to build the spirit to work in teams.

A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution and who is under
 learning with goals of acquiring knowledge, developing professions and achieving employment in a desired field.
  In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement
 with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or 
 decisive.
